# Pacman Game

This is a simple Pacman game in Python that uses the `turtle` module for the graphical interface and game logic. The game features Pacman trying to collect points on a board while being chased by ghosts. Additionally, the ghosts have movement behavior based on Pacman's location on a 2D Cartesian plane.

## Requirements

This game runs on Python 3 and utilizes the `turtle` module for the graphical interface. There's no need to install additional libraries.

## How to Play

- Control Pacman using the arrow keys: "Right" to move right, "Left" to move left, "Up" to move up, and "Down" to move down.
- The objective of the game is to collect the white dots on the board.
- Pacman must avoid the ghosts, which move in its direction.
- Earn points by collecting dots, and try to achieve the highest score.

## Instructions

1. Install Python 3 if you haven't already.
2. Run the Python script in your preferred development environment.
3. Use the arrow keys to control Pacman and navigate the game board.
4. Collect the white dots while avoiding the chasing ghosts.
5. The game will keep track of your score, which you can see at the top right corner of the screen.
6. Have fun and see how high of a score you can achieve!
7. Users can change the label by changing the tiles in the list, 0 is a wall and 1 is a road.
